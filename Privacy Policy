CHARS for Pathfinder ACG collects no data other than what is needed for its operation and what is
routinely collected by Google to analyze costumer usage. All information collected by CHARS is saved
on the device. The camera is used only for you, the user, to track your character deck, and the image is saved
to the device's local storage.
