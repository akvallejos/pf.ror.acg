Pathfinder ACG App
CHaracter Aid and Record System (CHARS) for Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is a simple app for tracking your character progression.

This is my first Android App, and was designed mainly to help me keep track of my characters. I created it because while there are other applications that track characters, none take advantage of the built-in camera that most devices have. And when I was first playing the game, the camera is how I would track my character's progress.

Under the Hood:
This is a stand alone application, meaning that all data is stored directly on your device. Deleting this application will result in the removal of your application's data as well. The camera is used solely for the purpose of taking pictures of your character's deck. The image is stored on your device as well. Only one image per character is stored, so taking a new picture will automatically delete the old one.
